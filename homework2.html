    <p>Image A: Luckily my lab class is during the late afternoon, meaning beautiful lines of shadow mark the Hunter buildings and really show off their detail.
        I liked this composition because of the layers of detailed lines between the North building, the East building, and the diagonal sky bridge at the bottom. As for the colors,
        I was inspired by the rolls of expired film that I've had developed, where the colors are returned softer and more washed out than I would expect new film to be. The colors in this photo
        make me long for summer and feeling the sun on my face outside.
