    <p>Image B: While exploring the school for this assignment, I visited hallways I'd never been before to see what I could find. This was one of the theater department rooms. 
        I loved the deep green color of the cabinets and the chrome on the chair shining from the dark. It's not as in focus as I'd like so I masked that slightly by adding texture 
        and grain to the image. If I could do the assignment again, I would use this image for the first crop, as I actually do not like how this crop (5"x7") compared to the original
        crop on the image, which is attached to the right. Something about the voyeuristic framing with the door and more view of the cabinets tells more of a story to me.
